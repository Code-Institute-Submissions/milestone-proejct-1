### **Design Choices**

#### **Font**
I used the Roboto Slab font for my headers and the lato font for my body as it lead to a professional easy-to-read design 

#### **Icons**
I used Font Awesome icons for my social media links and for my download icon as it gives a intuitive way for users to access the sites social media.

#### **Colors**
The color scheme was entirely based around the colour of the logo - I used dev tools to get the exact hex colour of both the yellow background and grey text. 

#### **Sliding Hero Header**
I took influence from sites such as [RX Gym](https://www.rxgym.co.uk/) and [Gold's Gym](https://www.goldsgym.com/) where they had the navbar behind a hero image with a slogan.  
I very much liked this design idea and thought it immediately gave users the ability to identify the purpose of the website as well as looking professional.

#### **Testimonials Format**
When researching gym websites I liked the layout on [UFC Gym](https://www.ufcgym.com/classes/) with image/text text/image and decided to sue that layout to display my testomonials.
